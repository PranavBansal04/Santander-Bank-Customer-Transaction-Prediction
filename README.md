# Santander-Bank-Customer-Transaction-Prediction

Predicting customer transactions is a crucial task for any financial institution as it helps them to identify potential fraud, retain valuable customers, develop personalized marketing strategies and provide services that can improve the overall experience of the customers. The goal of this project is to use data science to predict customer transactions for Santander, a leading global bank. By predicting customer transactions, the bank can proactively address customer needs and prevent fraud. By analysing the Santander customer transaction data, we can identify patterns and trends that indicate which customers are likely to make a specific transaction. In this project we have used various Machine Learning models and techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting etc to predict whether a customer will make a transaction or not. There has been a significant amount of work done to predict customer behaviour, however, most of the existing work focuses on telecom or retail industries. There is limited research on customer behaviour prediction in the banking industry, specifically on transaction-level data. This project aims to fill this gap by providing a solution for Santander customer transaction prediction using the latest machine learning techniques. The solution proposed in this project can be used to identify potentially fraudulent activity, as well as to better understand customers' spending patterns and tailor services accordingly. This can help Santander to reduce customer churn and increase customer retention, ultimately leading to increased revenue and a competitive advantage in the banking industry.
